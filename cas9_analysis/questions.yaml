task: >
  You have been given processed CRISPRâ€“Cas9 pooled screen results comparing Young (Y) and Old (O) NSCs under multiple conditions (RA, Kp, Q). Using the provided pooled quarter-of-files outputs,
  answer the following mixed-condition questions:

questions:
  - id: q1
    stage: quality_control
    text: "How many sgRNA elements are in the merged RA elements table (after pooling quarter-of-files)?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q2
    stage: quantification
    text: "What is the total read count in the pooled Young (Y) Kp sample (summed over all elements used in the merged table)?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q3
    stage: normalization
    text: "Which gene has the highest absolute mean_log2FC (O over Y) in Q?"
    answer_type: string_exact

  - id: q4
    stage: differential_enrichment
    text: "How many genes have q_gene <= 0.1 in RA?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q5
    stage: ranking
    text: "List the top 5 genes by descending absolute mean_log2FC in Kp."
    answer_type: ordered_list
